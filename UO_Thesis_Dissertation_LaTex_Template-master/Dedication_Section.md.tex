I dedicate my thesis to my father and my husband, who have been my support system throughout the journey. My father has been my inspiration and motivation throughout my life. Thank you to my husband for his immense support, understanding and unconditional love during this phase. I thank my mom, my sisters and my brother-in-law for encouraging me to pursue my dream to attend graduate school and being extremely supportive throughout. This achievement would not have been possible without all of you.
